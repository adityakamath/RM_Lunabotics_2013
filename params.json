The goal of the competition was for student teams to conceptualize, design and develop a robot capable of traversing a simulated lunar surface via teleoperation (Wi-Fi) or autonomously. Participating teams were also judged on their innovation, student outreach, social media outreach, technical presentation and systems engineering analysis. Points scored in all these divisions added up to a score upon which the Joe Kosmo Award for Excellence was based.
