how to connect a ACS714 Current Sense Carrier to the Arduino, 
and read current flowing through the sensor.



Vcc on carrier board to Arduino +5v
GND on carrier board to Arduino GND
OUT on carrier board to Arduino A0

Insert the power lugs into the loads positive lead circuit, 
arrow on carrier board points to load, other lug connects to 
power supply positive

*/

int analogInPin = A0;  // Analog input pin that the carrier board OUT is connected to
int sensorValue = 0;        // value read from the carrier board
int outputValue = 0;        // output in milliamps

void setup() {
  // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
  Serial.begin(9600); 
}

void loop() {
  // read the analog in value:
  sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);            
  // convert to milli amps
  outputValue = ((sensorValue * (5000/1024)) - 500)/0.133;  
/* sensor outputs about 100 at rest. 
Analog read produces a value of 0-1023, equating to 0v to 5v. 
There's a 500mv offset to subtract. 
The unit produces 133mv per amp of current, so
divide by 0.133 to convert mv to ma
          
*/
  // print the results to the serial monitor:
  Serial.print("sensor = " );                       
  Serial.print(sensorValue);      
  Serial.print("\t Current (ma) = ");      
  Serial.println(outputValue);   

  // wait 10 milliseconds before the next loop
  // for the analog-to-digital converter to settle
  // after the last reading:
  delay(10);                     
}
