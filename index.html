        <p>NASA Lunabotics Mining Competition 2013 had 50 teams participating from over 6 continents. The goal of the competition was for student teams to conceptualize, design and develop a robot capable of traversing a simulated lunar surface via teleoperation (Wi-Fi) or autonomously. Participating teams were also judged on their innovation, student outreach, social media outreach, technical presentation and systems engineering analysis. Points scored in all these divisions added up to a score upon which the Joe Kosmo Award for Excellence was based. RoboManipal, representing Manipal University stood #19 from the 50 teams.</p>
